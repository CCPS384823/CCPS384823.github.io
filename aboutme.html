<h1>About Me</h1>
<p id="mission_state"> Ethan Katz is working towards being the best student, worker, and athlete he can be. This includes having a good work ethic, being responsible, and playing the role of a good teammate to have in a work group or a sport. He has been playing baseball both casually and competitively for 10+ years which has helped him achieve all of these attributes. The idea of being the ideal student or worker can be a product of continuing to work hard and building strong, positive relationships with peers and those in higher positions. He believes that the values of keeping honesty and a constant correction mindset is the most important things he holds himself to. Staying honest keeps himself in line and makes it so that any type of praise or reward he gets looks good not only to the people around him, but it also means more to himself which also helps with his overall mindset. Speaking of mindset, he is constantly looking for ways to change and improve himself for the better of himself, but especially for the people around him working with him to improve all around efficiently. He takes critique others give him seriously and always does something to change whatever needs fixing. As a current student and baseball player for Naples High School as a freshman, he strives to be a top student and stay there. As of now, he holds a 4.16 GPA which ranks 4th in his class of over 400 people. He hopes he can get valedictorian at the end of senior year or at least finish top 5. Extracurricular goals include getting pulled up to Varsity baseball before the end of the 2023 Spring season and make Varsity at the start of next season. Ethan wants to be known for being the ideal person to work with, someone that doesn't give up easily and has excellent work ethic. Someone that everyone would want to work in a team with because of his unrelenting ways of constant improvement of efficiency. Someone that any company would be dashing to go hire. </p>
